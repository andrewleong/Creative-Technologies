##Instructions and Steps

1)	Before opening the prototype link, a mobile phone with QR scanner app is required. An Android phone would be ideal as it was used to test this project.

2)	For Android phone, please set your phone’s default browser to “Google Chrome”. Then go to this link, [chrome://flags/#disable-pull-to-refresh-effect](chrome://flags/#disable-pull-to-refresh-effect). 

You will see a highlighted yellow line that says Pull-to-refresh effect Android. Click DISABLE. This disables your browser’s ability to refresh when you scroll down with your finger. 

The purpose is to prevent your finger from accidentally refreshing the browser that will cause a disconnection between the desktop browser and mobile browser.

3)	After you have completed these steps, you can access the Heroku link provided in the report.

4)	To enable the feature again, go back to the same link above and click enable. 

##Unexpected application crashes 
1)	The application works perfectly fine, if there are any unexpected application crashes or not being able to work, please contact me.


##Playing the Game
These steps assumed you have opened the project and have played the game. This is a brief walkthrough for the game.

1)	To win the game, you have to collect a minimum of 10 heart game object (10 points). After that, to proceed to the winning page, your ice cream game object needs to be fully melted (died). To do that, either hit the orange fire balls (obstacles) or don’t collect more hearts, overtime your ice cream will melt. If you have failed to collect a minimum of 10 points and have melted, it will direct you to the losing page, which will prompt you to come back later to try again.

2)	In the winning page, it will show a Congratulations page with the number of points you collected. On your mobile phone, it will display a page and shows you have won a Free Cornetto Ice cream. On the bottom of the page shows a mock up Facebook Post where you can click the POST button. 


3)	It will direct you to an image of the Facebook feed, showing you have sent your friend an ice cream with wishes. You can click on the image page that directs you to the page where you can view as the friend’s perspective (The friend you sent free ice cream to). It is the final page where you can see the Cornetto barcode voucher.
